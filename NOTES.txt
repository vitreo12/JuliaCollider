GC ISSUES:
When turning GC back on in NRT thread, the RT thread could call into it when creating a new object.

Way to fix it:
Only ever create objects when the GC is disabled. Also, while in the middle of creating objects,
make sure that the GC cannot be turned back on. I need this two way check from the GC and the objects.
The priority must be the objects, as I can still collect the GC at a later stage. The GC collections, also,
most of the time will be of very small data, while the call is very expensive. Need to think of a way of 
only collecting when it is actually purposeful to do so.


NRT THREAD                      RT THREAD
jl_gc_enable(1);
                                 
//now gc is open,                   
                                jl_call...... (creating an object might trigger a gc call on rt thread)

jl_gc_collect(1);
