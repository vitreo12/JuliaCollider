GC ISSUES:
When turning GC back on in NRT thread, the RT thread could call into it when creating a new object.


NRT THREAD                      RT THREAD
jl_gc_enable(1);
                                 
//now gc is open,                   
                                jl_call...... (creating an object might trigger a gc call on rt thread)

jl_gc_collect(1);
