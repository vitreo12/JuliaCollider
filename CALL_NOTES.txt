1) jl_call could be too expensive, better to rely on jl_invoke:

- Created a jl_lookup_generic_SC function which would retrieve a jl_method_instance_t given
a function and arguments. Use it in jl_invoke_SC to invoke that specific jl_method_instance_t.
This way, I ignore all the jl_call overhead in looking for specific dispatch of functions.

- Could I perhaps use jl_gf_invoke() (it is the function used by invoke() in Julia)


2) IS IT SAFE TO HANDLE world_age FROM MULTIPLE THREADS???? It's a problem with 
   jl_call aswell, not just jl_invoke.

CALLS:

meth->invoke goes to:

1) JL_DLLEXPORT jl_value_t *jl_fptr_args(jl_method_instance_t *m, jl_value_t **args, uint32_t nargs), 
   which actually goes directly to assembly code.
