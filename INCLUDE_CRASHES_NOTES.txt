Include crashes are caused by the fact that the functions that have been precompiled (jl_method_instance_t*)
are not entirely inlined: they do not include the relative function calls they are making, but only
function pointers. This causes those function calls to be happening at a different world age is the 
NRT has changed it with new include() or precompile() calls. Maybe, when Julia will support PARTR, multiple
world ages will be fine and won't screw this up.

Solutions are:

1) Change the scope: Julia UGens outputs silence while recompiling:
    PROS: All Julia functions are possible to be safely called.
    CONS: Audio interrupt

2) Force the inling of everything. How???
