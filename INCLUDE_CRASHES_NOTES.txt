Include crashes are caused by the fact that the functions that have been precompiled (jl_method_instance_t*)
are not entirely inlined: they do not include the relative function calls they are making. This causes those function
calls to be happening at a different world age is the NRT has changed it with new include() or precompile() calls.
Solutions are:

1) Change the scope: Julia UGens outputs silence while recompiling:
    PROS: All Julia functions are possible to be safely called.

2) Force the inling of everything. How???
