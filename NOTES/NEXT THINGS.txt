TEST multi channel Data/Buffer.

1) Finish JuliaDef SC interface (autowatch, precompile into sysimg, etc...)

2) More reliable way of deleting old modules when recompiling

3) Implement a @debug macro for places where often the precompilation won't go.
   (for example, inner loops and conditions will escape variable checking)
   Maybe I could just precompile for a longer buffer?

4) Implement a Signal DataType, which will work for both Float32 and Float64

5) Implement input_names and output_names in JuliaDef

6) Implement JuliaDefProxy

7) Implement the Done action

8) Make @out(i) / @in(i) working

9) Revert SC_Julia.cpp to SC_Julia.c
